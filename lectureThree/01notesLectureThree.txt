Global Variable
var is how you can define a global variable.
  This would mean you can access that "var" variable from anywhere in the program

Optional Arguments
if you have multiple values but only one parameter it will
  take the first value and ignore the other two than still run (This is vice versa)

You can give a parameter a deafult value while in the () and if it is not given a value outside of that 
  it will take that value

  funtion example (x, y = 5) {

  }

  or 

  let example (x, y = 5) => {

  }

This value will get overturned from an outside value like...

  let example (x, y = 5) => {

  }

  example(5, 1)

  "y" value would then be 1 because its overuled
